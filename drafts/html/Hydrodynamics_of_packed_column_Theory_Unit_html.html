<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Chemical engineering operations commonly involve the use of packed and fluidized beds. These are devices in which a large surface area for contact between a liquid and a gas (absorption, distillation) or a solid and a gas or liquid (adsorption, catalysis) is obtained for achieving rapid mass and heat transfer, and particularly in the case of fluidized beds, catalytic chemical reactions. Here, we can discuss the experimental analysis to find out pressure drop and flooding characteristics in a packed column.</span></p>
<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">A typical packed bed is a cylindrical column that is filled with a suitable packing material. The liquid is distributed as uniformly as possible at the top of the column and flows downward, wetting the packing material. A gas is admitted at the bottom, and flows upward, contacting the liquid in a counter current fashion. An example of a packed bed is an absorber. Here, the gas contains some carrier species that is insoluble in the liquid (such as air) and a soluble species such as carbon dioxide or ammonia. The soluble species is absorbed in the liquid, and the lean gas leaves the column at the top. The liquid rich in the soluble species is taken out at the bottom.</span></p>
<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">From a fluid mechanical perspective, the most important issue is that of the pressure drop required for the liquid or the gas to flow through the column at a specified flow rate. To calculate this quantity we rely on a friction factor correlation attributed to Ergun. Other fluid mechanical issues involve the proper distribution of the liquid across the cross-section, and developing models of the velocity profile in the liquid film around a piece of packing material so that heat/mass transfer calculations can be made. Design of packing materials to achieve uniform distribution of the fluid across the cross-section throughout the column is an important subject as well. Here, we only focus on the pressure drop issue. Pressure drop for the dry packing is calculated by</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">Pressure drops are correlated in terms of (&Delta;P/L), the pressure drop per unit length of packing. The term, (&Delta;P/L), is usually expressed as "psi per foot of packing". </span></p>
