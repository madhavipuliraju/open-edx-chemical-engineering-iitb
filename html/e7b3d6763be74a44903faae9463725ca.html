<h2>Expt. 1: Static Characteristics of RTD</h2>
<h3>Aim: Study the change in resistance of RTD probe depending on the process temperature.</h3>
<h3>Step by step Procedure:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the material of RTD you want to use.&nbsp; Temperature coefficient (&alpha;) for the same will be displayed on the screen. Note this value.</li>
<li>Click on ' R0' to get the value of R0 for selected RTD. Note the same.</li>
<li>Click on 'Get Temp'. The temperature for which Rt is to be found will be displayed.</li>
<li>Using&nbsp; formula calculate the value of Rt and enter the answer in the box provided (upto 2 decimals with rounding off). Submit the answer using submit button.</li>
<li>If your calculation is correct, go to step 3. Repeat the procedure min 3 times.</li>
<li>If your calculation is wrong, you will be asked to repeat the same. Please refer to GET FORMULA tab and verify your calculations.</li>
<li>After finishing minimum 3 set of correct readings, you can see the graph by clicking on 'Plot'.</li>
<li>When the graph is displayed click Next tab to repeat the procedure with different reference resistance(R0) value and with&nbsp; different materials.</li>
<li>Minimum 3 calculations are necessary to plot the graph.</li>
<li>Study the graphs for RTD performance&nbsp; with different reference resistance values and different materials</li>
</ol>
