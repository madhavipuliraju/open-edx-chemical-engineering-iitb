<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>1) Ensure all valves are closed and outlet and bypass valves (see Fig. 1) of the pipe system are open. Ensure that pressure tapings are proper connected to the subject pipe, without air bubble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) Turn on the centrifugal pump and let water initially circulated back through bypass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) Open the first pipe inlet valve completely and operated direct the water flow appropriate flow meter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) Switch on the centrifugal pump, flow meter and pressure gauge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) Re ensure that there are no air bubbles in the tubes connected to the pressure tapings, remove if any air bubbles are present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Wait for one minute for the flow to reach steady state, although it may have fluctuation, however fluctuation between constant bound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Record the corresponding flow rate (liter per min) and pressure readings (bar) (Note: If flow rate is more than 10 lpm use flow meter 1(less precise) otherwise if flow rate is below 10 lpm then use flow meter 2(more precise)). Caution: While changing the flow meters, turn both the flow meters on, first and then turn off with is not required. In any case, high flow rate should not go the more precise meter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;8) Vary the flow rate by manipulating the bypass valve and record 5 such readings at various flow rates (flow rates could be altered by inlet valves as well, however, bypass valve is to be most commonly used.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;9) Repeat the above steps for rest of the pipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;10) For measurement of pressure drop of pipe bend, connect the pressure taping to bend and repeated the procedure for pipe (Any inlet valve could be kept open).</p>
<p>&nbsp;11) Once all readings are recorded, switch off centrifugal pump, flow meter and pressure gauge and fully open the bypass valve. Inlet valve of all the pipes are to be turned off.</p>
