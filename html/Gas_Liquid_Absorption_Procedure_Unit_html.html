<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p></p>
<p>1) Prepare 20 liter of 1N NaOH solution in a feed tank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Check the concentration of the feed solution by titration against 0.1 N HCl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Fill the bubbling pot with 3 liters of above prepared solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Check the concentration of the bubbling pot solution by titration against 0.1N HCl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Set the flow rate of NaOH solution to 10 L/H.(you can set any point from slider)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Set the flow rate of carbon dioxide gas to 90 L/H. (you can set any point from slider)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Set the flow rate of air to 30 L/H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) Take sample at 10, 20, 30 minutes from column outlet and bubbling pot outlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Titrate the sample collected, using phenolphthalein indicator against 0.1N HCl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) Titrate the same sample, using methyl orange indicator against 0.1 N HCl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) Calculate the balance on NaOH and CO2.</p>
