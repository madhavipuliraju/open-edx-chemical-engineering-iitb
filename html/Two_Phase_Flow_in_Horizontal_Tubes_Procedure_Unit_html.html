<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: left;">The flow rate for water and is selected by varying the valve positions. Flow rate of water can be measured by the bucket and stopwatch method. The air flow rate can be read from the rotameter. The flow regime that develops in the pipe can be observed and reported. This flow regime can be verified theoretically by studying the graph given in the theory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: left;">As the water and air flows a pressure drop is developed across the pipe which is reflected in a height difference across the manometer. The experimental pressure drop can be calculated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: left;">A suitable correlation such as the Lockhart-Martinelli method can be used to calculate the pressure drop theoretically. The correlation is given in the theory.</p>
