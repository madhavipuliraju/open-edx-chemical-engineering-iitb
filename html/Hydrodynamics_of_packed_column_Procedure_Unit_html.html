<h2 class="divContent">Procedure</h2>
<div class="divContent"><br /><ol>
<li>Check that the liquid in all the manometers is at the equal levels.</li>
<li>Dry Packing Pressure Drop:<ol type="a">
<li>Introduce the air into the column at a low flow rate without the liquid flow. Allow the gas to run for 5 to 10 minutes till the liquid columns in the manometers are stabilized. Record the pressure drop across the packing &Delta;P in the manometer C and air flow rate in the manometer A.</li>
<li>Increase the air flow rate and again record &Delta;P vs. gas flow rate. Take minimum six reading by increasing the gas flow rate, covering the whole range in the manometer C.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pressure Drop in the Irrigated Packing:<ol type="a">
<li>Stop the gas flow and fill the water in the column to be completely submerged and wet the packing. Allow the air bubbles to escape. When the packing is completely wet, drain off the water.</li>
<li>Adjust a small water flow rate and allow it to run for a few minutes. Introduce the air at a small flow rate. Allow the system to come to steady state and take the readings, in the manometer.</li>
<li>Increase the gas rate while keeping the liquid rate same and record the manometer readings. A minimum six gas rates covering the whole gas flow range have to be taken for each liquid rate.</li>
<li>Cut off the air flow and again repeat the procedure 3a, 3b and 3c for an increased liquid rate. This procedure has to be repeated for at least five liquid flow rates covering the whole range of the manometer.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Measurement of the packing properties:<ol type="a">
<li>Measure the height of the packing (Z) by a scale.</li>
<li>Column diameter: Fill the water in the column and rain a measured empty height in a measuring cylinder. The column in diameter D can be calculated.</li>
<li>Void fraction: Fill the column with the water so as to completely submerge the packing. Drain the water and collect the water volume drained as the water level falls from the top to bottom of the packing. Calculate the void fraction (Ïµ) from this.</li>
<li>Measure the geometrical dimensions of the packing and calculate a<sub>p</sub> and other important packing properties.</li>
</ol></li>
