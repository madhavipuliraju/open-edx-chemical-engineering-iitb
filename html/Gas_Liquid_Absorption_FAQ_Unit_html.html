<h2><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<p><b>Q1.</b> Why packing is required in absorption?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> Packing in absorption column enhances the contact surface between two phases. Also it results in increase in gas pressure drop.</p>
<p><b>Q2.</b>How the extent of absorption varies with variation in flow rate of gas?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> Increase in gas flow rate results increase in absorption but there is an upper limit. This limit is called flooding in which part of liquid phase move upwards due to high pressure of gaseous phase and hence decrease in absorption.</p>
<p><b>Q3.</b>What are the two major types of packing? Which one is more frequently used and why?</p>
<p><b>A.&nbsp;</b>Packings are of two major types, random and regular.</p>
<p>Random packings are simply dumped into the tower during installation and allowed to fall at random. It offers larger specific surfaces (and larger gas-pressure drop) in the smaller sizes, but they cost less per unit volume in the larger sizes.</p>
<p>Regular packing is done by stacking the packing materials in regular manner. It offers the advantage of low pressure drop for the gas and greater possible fluid flow rates, usually at the expense of more costly installation than random packing.</p>
<p>Random packing is more frequently used than regular packing because of its easy low cost installation.</p>
<p><b>Q4.</b> Why the temperature of column raised during absorption process?</p>
<p><b>A.&nbsp;</b>Absorption is an exothermic process.</p>
