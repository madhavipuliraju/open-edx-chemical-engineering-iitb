<p>The object of this experiment is to study gas liquid absorption in an absorption column:-</p>
<ol>
<li>The reaction of carbon dioxide when it is contacted with sodium hydroxide solution.</li>
<li>To compare the performance of a packed column (continuous process) with a bubble column (semi-batch process).</li>
<li>To observe the effect of different flow rates on the performance of the two columns<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: #333333;">.</span></li>
