For example, pipes of different diameters and valves can be used to change flow rates of the fluid, while bends are used to change the direction of flow of the fluid. The effect that each of this equipment has on the flow of the fluid must be known to chemical engineers, so that more efficient piping networks can be designed.</span></p>
<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">Valves commonly used in industries are globe valves, ball valves and gate valves. Globe valves offer maximum precision in controlling the flow, whereas ball valves are mainly used to either allow maximum flow or stop the flow completely.</span></p>

Centrifugal pump convert kinetic energy of impellers into potential energy of water. Positive displacement pumps work on the principle of trapping a fixed amount of water and then forcing it through the discharge tube.</span></p>

Roughness parameter is the ratio of the pitch of the thread to the diameter of the pipe. For pipes of equal diameter, the friction factor and hence the pressure drop of the rough pipe is more. In the laminar region, there is no effect of the roughness because the layer near the walls of the pipe is stationary and there is no lateral mixing. However in the turbulent region, it plays an important role as there is lateral mixing and greater the roughness parameter, greater is the resistance offered to the flow. </span></p>

Finally, the roughness parameter of the rough pipe is calculated using the experimental value of friction factor. The Fanning friction factor is evaluated using the equation: </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">Where &Delta;P is the pressure drop, L is the length of the pipe, D is the inner diameter, v is the velocity of the fluid and &rho; is the density of the fluid. </span></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The theoretical value of the friction factor is given by the Colebrook-White Equation,</p>

<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">In this equation, f is the Fanning friction factor, D is the inner diameter and &epsilon; is the absolute roughness parameter. </span></p>
