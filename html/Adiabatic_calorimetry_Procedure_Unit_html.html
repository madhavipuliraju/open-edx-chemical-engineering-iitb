<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>1) Add 150 ml of water to the calorimeter. Switch on the supply of electric current and start the timer. Note the average current value, Voltage drop across resistor and time for which current is passed. Calculate K using Equation 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) Calculate the volumes of methanol and water required to make 150 ml of solution such that mole fraction of methanol is 0.2. Pour the component with larger volume in the calorimeter. Note the initial temperature. Then add the component with smaller volume and allow the mixture to attain steady state and note the temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) Now switch on the current supply. Allow the current to pass through the mixture till a temperature rise of about 2ì§¸C is observed. Note the initial and final temperatures and also the ammeter reading, voltmeter reading and time for which current is passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for mixtures of composition 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mole fraction of methanol.</p>
