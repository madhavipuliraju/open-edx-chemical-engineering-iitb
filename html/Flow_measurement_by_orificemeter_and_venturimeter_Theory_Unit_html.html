<h2>Flow measurement by orificemeter and venturimeter<br /><br /></h2>
<p>Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement. It is important<br />to know the amount of material entering and exiting the process to control<br />various industrial processes. Different types of meters are used for flow<br />measurement and it is selected based on the applicability of the instrument on<br />a specific problem, installed cost and costs of operation, the range of flow<br />rates, and its accuracy.<br /><br />In the following sections we will be discussing about the venturimeter and<br />orifice meter, vastly used in the industries for flow measurement of liquids<br />and gases.<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Venturimeter<br /><br /></h2>
<p>Venturimeter works on the principle of head flowmeter. Venturi tube gradually<br />reduces the flow area, thus creating differential pressure across it. Any<br />changes in fluid flow rate through venture are measured in terms of<br />diffenential pressure across it.</p>
<p>It consists of convergent inlet cone (having included angle between, 19 degree<br />to 23 degree), a uniform diameter throat (having length equal to its diameter)<br />and a divergent outlet cone (having included angle between 5 degree to 15<br />degree).<br /><br />The high pressure tap located on the convergent section while low pressure tap<br />is located at the middle of the throat. The manometer is connected between<br />these taps.<br /><br /></p>
