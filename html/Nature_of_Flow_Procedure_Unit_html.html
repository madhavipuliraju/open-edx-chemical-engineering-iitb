<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>1) Allow the water to fill the equipment and adjust the flow rate to the lowest possible value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) Adjust the flow rate of the dye solution so that its flow rate is the same as the velocity of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) Measure the volumetric flow rate using a measuring vessel and a stop watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) Increase the flow rate of water in small increments and repeat the above steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) From the highest flow rate decrease the flow rate in small decrements, and repeat the above steps.</p>
